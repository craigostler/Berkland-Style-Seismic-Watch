# Berkland-Style Seismic Watch 🌙🌎

**LunarQuake** – *When the moon pulls, the Earth shakes.*

An interactive, modern dashboard inspired by Jim Berkland’s unconventional earthquake prediction method.  
Tracks earthquake activity alongside moon phases, perigee dates, and Berkland’s 8-day “seismic windows” using live USGS data and lunar calculations.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Live Earthquake Feed** – pulls real-time data from the USGS Earthquake API.
- **Moon Phase & Perigee Tracking** – calculates lunar position and closest approach dates.
- **Seismic Windows** – highlights Berkland’s 8-day periods of higher quake likelihood.
- **Interactive Charts** – visualize quake frequency over time.
- **Clean Modern UI** – built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS.
